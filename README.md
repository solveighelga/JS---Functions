# JS---Functions
## Functions was hard to begin with, I'm still no expert, but after this guide I feel like I am getting a better hang of it
## Add contact
### Sm√°ri really helped me out understanding how to keep going with the guide by giving us this example on Slacks. From this I was able to make the rest of the functions.
## Remove email
### It look some time but I finally found that slice(i, 1) worked to remove only one item from the list
## Edit email
### Here I used newData to update whatever contact I wanted to edit. This took some time to figure out where to place newData in the function.
## Get email
### I used my previous work from our loops project to get the emails in a vertical order so this was the easiest function for me.
## listAll() and Clear()
### These two functions I took out the if part because there was no need to check for emails to continue with the function. for the list I also used what I had learned from our loops project and for Clear I used what I had learned from the Remove email function.
